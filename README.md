# pet-maheshwari README

This is the README for your extension "pet-maheshwari". After writing up a brief description, we recommend including the following sections.

## Features

The Motivation extension for Visual Studio Code sends a notification every 5 minutes with a random animal emoji and a random motivational quote to keep you inspired and focused while coding. The extension uses an external API to fetch motivational quotes and generates a random animal emoji to add some fun to your coding experience.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:
Sub-Folder in src folder
\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)
